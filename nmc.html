            <h2>New Media Certificate Summary</h2>
            <p style="max-width: 940px; margin: 0 auto; word-wrap: break-word; line-height: 1.6;">
                As a computer science major, my coursework has focused primarily on building a strong foundational understanding of the
                mathematical principles and theoretical concepts behind coding. While this provided me with a solid academic base, it 
                didn't involve as much hands-on coding. However, through the New Media Certificate program, I was able to bridge this 
                gap and apply my foundational knowledge to practical projects in front-end development, including web development and iOS app creation.  
            <br><br>
                Beyond technical skills, the certificate also offered classes like New Media Industries and TEDxUGA, which helped me develop professional
                skills such as teamwork and effective communicationâ€”key components of a successful career. At the end of the certificate journey, I had the 
                opportunity to integrate everything I had learned in the New Media Capstone course. In this course, I worked with an incredible development
                team to create an iOS app for the iPad using Apple's development tools.  
            <br><br>
                This journey through the New Media Certificate not only strengthened my technical abilities but also allowed me to immerse myself more deeply in
                technology, blending both creativity and technical expertise.
